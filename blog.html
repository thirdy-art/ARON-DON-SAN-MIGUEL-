            <h2>What Are Computer Viruses?</h2>
            <p>Computer viruses are malicious programs that can replicate themselves and spread from one computer to another. They typically infect files or software and can cause damage by corrupting or deleting data, slowing down the system, or rendering software unusable.</p>
            <p>Common ways a virus spreads include email attachments, infected software downloads, and external devices like USB drives. It's crucial to have effective security measures in place to prevent such infections.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Malware</h2>
            <p>Malware, short for "malicious software," is a general term that encompasses various types of harmful programs, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can steal personal information, encrypt files for ransom, or hijack your computer to use in cyberattacks.</p>
            <p>It is important to be cautious when downloading files or clicking on links from unknown sources to reduce the risk of malware infections.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>What is Spam?</h2>
            <p>Spam refers to unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate messages, primarily sent via email. These messages usually promote unwanted products or services and can sometimes contain harmful links or attachments designed to spread viruses and malware.</p>
            <p>While most spam is harmless, it can be overwhelming and dangerous if clicked on without caution. Spam filters are commonly used to block such emails from reaching your inbox.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>How Antivirus Software Protects You</h2>
            <p>Antivirus software is essential for protecting your devices from viruses, malware, and other malicious threats. These programs scan files, emails, and web pages for known threats and block or remove them before they can cause harm.</p>
            <p>Modern antivirus programs not only provide protection against viruses but also defend against phishing attacks, spyware, ransomware, and other cyber threats. Regular updates and real-time protection features are essential to keeping your system secure.</p>
